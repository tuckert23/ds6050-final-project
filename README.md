### Data
The data from this project came from Max Horowitz, et al. on Kaggle. The URL to this dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016). The data was too large to upload to GitHub. However, a subset of the data can be found in the data folder as the zip file `data_subset.csv.zip`.
